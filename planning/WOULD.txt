W - Walk Through It

We are going to create a social media web application. It's goal is to connect likeminded people with common interests and hobbies and/or
students with common subjects. The users are able to create posts describing specific interests, hobbies, activities or uni subjects. 
The posts are all public and other users can express interest by liking them and/or commenting them. Also they have the ability to make
a friend request to the user behind the post. If that person accepts both of them will be added to each others' contact list. After that 
they will be able to send instant messages to each other. Additionally, users can form group chats with multiple people from their
contacts list. 

Users will be able to:
1) Authenticate with Azure Active Director B2C through google and/or a WebFlexers account
2) Create public posts and add tags to them (e.g. Science, Music, History...)
3) Search the posts by tag and/or by keywords
4) Add others as personal contacts
5) Exchange instant messages between each other or
with multiple people in a group chat. 
6) Get notified for new messages
